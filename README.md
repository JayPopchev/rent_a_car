# Rent a car

RentACar is a simple car rental system that allows users to view available cars, rent a car, or return a rented car. It simulates a rental process by keeping track of car availability, rental prices, and car details such as brand, model, and rental status. 

# Features

- View Available Cars: Users can see a list of available cars for rent, including information like car brand, model, rental price per day, and status (available/rented).
- Rent a Car: Users can select a car by its ID and rent it if it is available. The system updates the car status to "rented."
- Return a Car: Users can return a rented car by selecting its ID. The system updates the car status to "available" and displays the rental price for payment.
- Exit: The system provides an option to exit the program.

# Future improvements

- While the current version of the RentACar system is simple and functional, there are several potential improvements and features that could enhance the system:
- User Authentication: Add user login and registration functionality so that users can have personalized accounts for tracking rented cars.
- Car Categories: Implement different car categories (e.g., Economy, Luxury, SUV) with different rental prices and features.
- Reservation System: Allow users to reserve cars for a specific date and time before actually renting.
- Payment Integration: Integrate a simple payment system to process payments and show a receipt for the rental.
- Car Maintenance: Track the maintenance status of each car and mark cars as unavailable if they need servicing.
